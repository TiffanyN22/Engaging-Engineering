#About Engaging Engineering
---
Engaging Engineering is a program I founded to increase middle and high school student's interest and understanding of code through workshops that cover various coding languages using informative lectures, hands-on projects, and games that showcase the applications of computer science.  More information about Engaging Engineering, along with the topics covered during each workshop, can be found on our website: https://sites.google.com/view/engagingengineering

##Projects
Within this repository are the bigger projects I coded and guided students through creating during our 2022 Summer Intermediate Workshop Series.  This workshop series was designed to introduce students with little coding experience to the fundamentals of text code by going over Python, C++, and Java.

##Workshops Project Breakdown:
###Intro to Python:
1. 'SimonSays': Game of Simon Says that prompts the user to enter certain words and sees if they correctly followed Simon's instructions. 
2. 'EnterPW': Program that mimics entering a password and giving a hint after 3 tries.

###Intermediate Python
1. 'Hero': Uses video-game type heroes to cover classes.

###Intro to C++:
1. 'NumberGuessingGame': Number Guessing Game that will generate a random number from 1 to 100, let the user guess numbers, tells the user if their guess was too high or too low, and counts the number of tries it takes them to guess the correct number.
2. 'LargestNum': Code to find the largest number in an array.
3. 'RandomPWGenerator': Program that generates a random string of letters

###Intermediate C++:
1. 'RockPaperScissor': Game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that lets the user select their move and play against the computer
2. 'Building': Code for Buildings and Addresses to practice coding classes

###Intro to Java:
1. 'Bank': This program mimcis a bank that allows the user to deposit money, withdraw money, see their balance, and perform multiple transactions.
2. 'MultiplicationTable': Code that makes and prints out a multiplication table

###Intermediate Java:
1. 'Animals': Program to create animals, cats, and monkeys
2. 'Hangman': Simplified game of hangman that allows the user to guess letters until they get the correct word.
