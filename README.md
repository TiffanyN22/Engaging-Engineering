#About Engaging Engineering
---
Engaging Engineering is a program I founded to increase middle and high school student's interest and understanding of code through workshops that cover various coding languages using informative lectures, hands-on projects, and games that showcase the applications of computer science.  More information about Engaging Engineering, along with the topics covered during each workshop, can be found on our website: https://sites.google.com/view/engagingengineering

##Projects
Within this repository are the bigger projects I coded and guided students through creating during our 2022 Summer Intermediate Workshop Series.  This workshop series was designed to introduce students with little coding experience to the fundamentals of text code by going over Python, C++, and Java.

##Workshops Project Breakdown:
###Intro to Python:
1. 'SimonSays': Game of Simon Says that prompts the user to enter certain words and sees if they correctly followed Simon's instructions.  This program utilizes variables, prints, user input, math, and if statements.
2. 'EnterPW': Program that mimics entering a password and giving a hint after 3 tries by using variables, prints, user input, while loops, and if statements.

###Intermediate Python
1. 'Hero': Uses video-game type heroes to cover classes

###Intro to C++:
1. 'NumberGuessingGame': Number Guessing Game that will generate a random number from 1 to 100, let the user guess numbers, tells the user if their guess was too high or too low, and counts the number of tries it takes them to guess the correct number.  This program covers rand, variables, do while loop, if/else statements, print with cout, and user input
2. 'LargestNum': Code to find the largest number in an array as practice for creating arrays and looping through them with a for loop
3. 'RandomPWGenerator': Program that generates a random string of letters using arrays, rand, and for loops.

###Intermediate C++:
1. 'RockPaperScissor': Game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that lets the user plays against the computer and uses defines, do while loops, rand, if else statements, and switch cases.
2. 'Building': Code for Buildings and Addresses to practice coding classes in c++

###Intro to Java:
1. 'Bank': This program mimcis a bank that allows the user to deposit money, withdraw money, see their balance, and perform multiple transactions.  It utilizes scanner for user input, variable, do while loops, printing with println, printing formatted numbers with printf, and if statements.
2. 'MultiplicationTable': Code that makes and prints out a multiplication table using 2D arrays, for loops, and formatted printing with printf.

###Intermediate Java:
1. 'Animals': Program to create animals, cats, and monkeys to practice classes and inheritance with Java syntax.
2. 'Hangman': Simplified game of hangman that allows the user to guess letters until they get the correct word. The code uses scanner for user input, arrays, rand, and common String methods.
